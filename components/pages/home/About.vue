      <h4 >I'm a developer living in the great state of Washington.</h4>
      <p>
        In a past life, I attended university and got my Bachelor's in
        Elementary Education. After spending some time teaching in a variety of
        grade levels and schools as a sub, I decided to try something entirely
        different and made the leap into Digital Analytics and Full Stack Web
        Development - starting my own company, Redmane Digital.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mt-md-4">I've got many different hobbies.</h4>
      <p>
        Code and technology are a given, but I also enjoy finding new craft
        breweries and craft beers, traveling to new places, dabbling in music
        production, writing, and learning new things - no matter what the
        subject. My 4 year old mixed-breed pup, Harley, is my ever-ready
        adventure buddy. She's basically the best.

          <h4 class="mb-3">I'm a Christian.</h4>
          <p>
            I was raised in the church, attending services each Sunday where my
            grandfather was pastor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though my faith was strong, high school brought about doubt around
            what and how I believed. After going to college and having the
            opportunity to explore the Bible and my faith, I solidified my
            understanding of God, the Bible, and his free gift of grace to all
            who are willing to receive it.

            “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more
            that you learn, the more places you'll go.”

            I believe that you never stop moving forward until you stop
            learning. One of my primary drives in life is to gain new knowledge
            and to expand the knowledge I already have.

        <div class="col-12 col-md-4 mt-4 mt-md-0">
          <h4 class="mb-3">I'm a creator.</h4>
          <p>
            In my life, I've found that creative output is a powerful form of
            self-expression and introspection.
          </p>
          <p>
            My primary means of expression are in the form of poetry and essays,
            as well as digital paintings and music. Each piece on here is
            cataloged because it's a glimpse of me at any given time throughout
            my life.
